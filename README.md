--- QUESTION 1 --- <br>
With the product and the current number both start at 1, the multiplication loop will carry out as: <br>
1 * 1 = 1 <br>
1 * 2 = 2 # The current number will increase by 1 each time after the multiplication is carried out <br>
2 * 3 = 6 <br>
6 * 4 = 24 <br>
24 * 5 = 120 # This is where the loop stops because it exceed the threshold, for which the threshold = 100 <br>
Before printing the final product, since the last multiplication is carried out to get the final product, the current number is currently at 6 <br>
To get the number that causes the product to exceed the threshold, we just simply take the current number minus 1, then print it out along with the final product <br>
